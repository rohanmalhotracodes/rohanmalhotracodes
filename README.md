# Hi, I’m Rohan 👋

Computer Engineering student at **Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology** with interests in **open-source development, backend systems, and applied machine learning**.

I like working on real codebases — reading existing architecture, fixing bugs, improving performance, and writing changes that are easy to review and maintain.
